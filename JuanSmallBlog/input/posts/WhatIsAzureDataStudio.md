### Why it might be useful.
Azure Data Studio would be a good option to try if you work in a team, you can write up queries and share them across your team. It has built in Git support, a terminal and native Jupter Notebook.

### How do i get it?
You can download [Azure Data Studio](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/developer-tools/data-studio/).

### What is my take on Azure Data Studio?
After trying it out for a few times, I liked the features that it offers when i am focused on analitical tasks. It allows me to write queries in a notebook so that i can explain my queries sussinctly and clearly. This is a major plus. I wish it wasnt named Azure Data Studio though since it presumes that I need Azure to do it. You don't. You just need a database connection.
