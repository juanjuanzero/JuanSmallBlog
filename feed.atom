&lt;p&gt;Azure Data Studio would be a good option to try if you work in a team, you can write up queries and share them across your team. It has built in Git support, a terminal and native Jupter Notebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="how-do-i-get-it"&gt;How do i get it?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/developer-tools/data-studio/"&gt;Azure Data Studio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="what-is-my-take-on-azure-data-studio"&gt;What is my take on Azure Data Studio?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After trying it out for a few times, I liked the features that it offers when i am focused on analitical tasks. It allows me to write queries in a notebook so that i can explain my queries sussinctly and clearly. This is a major plus. I wish it wasnt named Azure Data Studio though since it presumes that I need Azure to do it. You don't. You just need a database connection.&lt;/p&gt;
